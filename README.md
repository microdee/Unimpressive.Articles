# Unimpressive.Articles

Statically served, all-client, Markdown and React based bare-bones article reader website boilerplate for lazy and/or poor people who still wants total control tho. You can call this a CMS if you want to insult real CMS's.

Based on this repository: https://github.com/rafrex/react-github-pages but with updated npm packages, a lot happened in 4 years.  
(Except React-Router, they had a significant API change at 4.0+, years ago, so for now we're stuck with 3.x)

Originally designed for Github pages, but works with a dead simple default nginx as well.
